			Being a student at the Turing school of software and design has been a
			challenging yet rewarding experience. Turing has set a new bar for what
			can be achieved in a short amount of time: I would never imagined that after
			mod 1 I would be fell competent about a language that was all but foreign
			to me when I started here at Turing.
